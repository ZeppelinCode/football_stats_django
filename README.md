# Future improvements
1. AJAX search bar
2. Improve search by using Unidecode to convert Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf to Fortuna Dusseldorf for easier searching
3. The background API sync task is configured to run every hour. Ideally, it should run every minute if
   a match is in progress in order to display up to date info.
4. Actually store the team images locally.
